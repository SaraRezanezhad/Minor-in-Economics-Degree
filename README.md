A complementary academic program completed alongside my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering.

Key skills and competencies gained:

Statistical and econometric methods (including Stata/R)

Understanding of markets, incentives, and decision-making

This minor strengthened my interdisciplinary background, especially in areas where technology, policy, and economics intersect.
